# |<----  Using a Maximum Of 50 Characters  ---->|
# <type>(area_name): (If applied, this commit will...) <subject> 
# Explain why this change is being made:

# |<----   Try To Limit Each Line to a Maximum Of 72 Characters   ---->|
#
# Type can be (common):
#    feat     =  new feature
#    fix      =  bug fix
#    refactor =  code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#    chore    =  Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries 
#                (documentation generation, version file, etc)
#
# (uncommon)
#    test     =  adding missing or correcting existing tests
#    docs     =  documentation-only changes (treat public-facing documentation 
#                as functional code; use feat(), fix(), etc)
#    style    =  changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (whitespace,
#                formatting, etc)
#    perf     =  change that improves performance
#    revert   =  change that is the exact opposite of the mentioned commit ID
# --------------------
# Remember to:
#    Capitalize the subject line
#    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    Do not end the subject line with a period
#    Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
