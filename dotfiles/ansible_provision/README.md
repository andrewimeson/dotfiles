# Ansible Provision

Ansible Playbook for provisioning my systems.

To start, we can't use venv on a Mac because Python3 doesn't ship with it, just
2.7. So, we'll install it globally. That something I should improve is to
automatically uninstall the global version once it's far enough along.


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
